# Neural network with backprop from scratch 

# Dependencies 

- networkx 
- matplotlib 3.5.0, this version is needed due to this bug in NX
- graphviz

As no proper installer is available for graphviz, on Windows you have to download, unpack the folder anywhere and add the bin subfolder to the PATH environment variable such that the drawing of the graph works.
